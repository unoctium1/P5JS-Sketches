## [Bubbles](Bubbles/)
A very simple attempt at using DOM to make a fully configurable sketch
## [Pointillism](Pointillism/)
### [Mirror](https://editor.p5js.org/unoctium1/full/EHw1At8ly)
Renders the given image in a pointillist style, click to fill in a region faster. For some reason this seems to have issues with github hosting, so I recommend the above mirror.
## [Noise Screen](ScreenJS/)  <span style="color:red">**Warning: Flashing colors**</span>
I wanted to get a VHS screen effect. This is not really what I was going for, but I am very happy with it.

Click to change pixel size, p to pause, space to turn off random color seed. Hit c, v, b, n, or m to change pixel style.

### [Screen Mask Variant](ScreenMask/)
### [Screen Mask Exclusion](ScreenMaskExclude/)
All the above controls are supported

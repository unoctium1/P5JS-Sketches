### [Bubbles]("../P5JS-Sketches/Bubbles/")
A very simple attempt at using DOM to make a fully configurable sketch
### [Pointillism]("../P5JS-Sketches/Pointillism/")
* [Mirror](https://editor.p5js.org/unoctium1/full/EHw1At8ly)
Renders the given image in a pointillist style, click to fill in a region faster. For some reason this seems to have issues with github hosting, so I recommend the above mirror.
### [Noise Screen]("../P5JS-Sketches/ScreenJS/")
* Warning: Flashing colors
I wanted to get a VHS screen effect. This is not really what I was going for, but I am very happy with it.
Click to change pixel size, p to pause, space to turn off random color seed. Hit c, v, b, n, or m to change pixel style.
#### [Screen Mask Variant]("../P5JS-Sketches/ScreenMask/")
#### [Screen Mask Exclusion]("../P5JS-Sketches/ScreenMaskExclude/")
All the above controls are supported
